#Project Description

This project is looking at accelerometer data from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone from this site:

I've extracted all of the mean and standard deviaiton variables in all data sets provided, then summarised them into a grouped table.
This is all performed using run_analysis.R, where each step is commented in the script in this repository. A codebook describing the varibales is provided.
